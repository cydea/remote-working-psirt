# Remote Working PSIRT Information

The novel coronavirus COVID-19 has led to many countries around the world mandating that citizens practice social distancing and stay at home. This has led to a huge surge in remote working. Organisations are rapidly adopting new technology solutions that allow users to access company resources and participate in remote meetings.

IT and Security Teams may not be familiar with the security arrangements, or where to keep up to date on security updates, for these new solutions.

This page aggregates a list of the most popular solutions in the following categories:

 - [Video Conferencing (VC)](#video-conferencing-vc)
 - [Virtual Private Network (VPN)](#virtual-private-network-vpn)
 - [Remote Access Gateway (RAG)](#remote-access-gateway-rag)

For each vendor there are links to:

 - Vendor-provided guidance and tips for securely configuring their software
 - Support sites where security advisories and updates can be found
 - Any notification options to have this information delivered to you automatically
